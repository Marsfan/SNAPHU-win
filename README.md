# SNAPHU Windows Build

**THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL BUILD OF SNAPHU, I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE STANFORD RADAR INTERFEROMETRY RESEARCH GROUP**

SNAPHU is a tool used to unwrap phase images used radar interferometry.
It is developed by Stanford University, and the full source code can be found here:
[https://web.stanford.edu/group/radar/softwareandlinks/sw/snaphu/](https://web.stanford.edu/group/radar/softwareandlinks/sw/snaphuradar/)

The Stanford website does not contain pre-compiled binaries of this program. This is normally not a problem, as it can
be found in many Linux Software Repositories. However, this is not possible on Windows. While the European Space Agency
does provide a pre-built Windows binary (found here:
[http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/snaphu/](http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/snaphu/))
It is for a much older version of SNAPHU.

In this repository, I have a pre-built image SNAPU for Windows. I built it using
MSYS2, as that is what the ESA webpage says they used to build the Windows Binaries. Additionally, I have documented
the process that I took to build the executable.

I hope to keep the version of SNAPHU up to date, and may use GitHub actions to automate the build process.

If you are a member of the SNAPHU development team, and would like me to take this repository down, please contact me
with further information at Marsfan@users.noreply.github.com. This will redirect to my personal email address, and I
will respond as soon as possible.
